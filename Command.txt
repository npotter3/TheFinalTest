git add MyFile.txt
git commit -m "[message]"
git add Info*
git config --globa user.name "Noah Potter_INFO"
git add Command.txt

Current Project status is in line with listed steps so far. MyFile.txt, Info
and it's two files, and Command.txt have all been created and used as required. 
For step 6 I opened the file manually and added the course name and code at the top. 
During this task i learned that sometimes the best way to do things is the simplest,
rather than trying to find a fancy workaround, sometimes opening the file and adding
the content to the beginning manually is the better option :)
